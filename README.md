All images in this repo links to the actual database login on the backend. I can show you the database backend if you wish but only with zoom, i won't provide the access to the server database. 

I attached here the screenshots of the said logic, including a brief video clip of what the actual database has. As you'll see on the video, it has more than 50+ procedures and 30+ tables, BayanCash is only part of the database, exposing the access will also expose the underlying system that links to it.

If you want to try the app, access it here " https://www.dropbox.com/s/3zpwx0xjey72ctw/Sentri.apk?dl=0 ", i'm still waiting for the approval of the update in google play store, Sentri is in Google Play Store already, but BayanCash is on the update that isn't yet approved. (See SentriGooglePlay.png)
